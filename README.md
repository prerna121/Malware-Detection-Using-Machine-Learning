# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on training models to detect malware using various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Utilizing a dataset of known malware and benign files, the models are trained and evaluated to provide accurate predictions for identifying malicious software. The project aims to compare the performance of these algorithms in effectively detecting malware.
